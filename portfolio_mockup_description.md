# Aseel Omar - Portfolio Mockup Description

This document outlines the textual description of the portfolio website mockup for Aseel Omar, a recent bootcamp graduate aiming to create an eye-catching and professional online presence for potential employers.

## General Design Principles:

*   **Overall Style:** Modern, clean, professional, and user-friendly.
*   **Responsiveness:** The design must be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Consistency:** Uniformity in font styles, button designs, color palette, spacing, and visual elements across all sections.
*   **Whitespace:** Generous use of whitespace to enhance readability and create an uncluttered aesthetic.
*   **Accessibility:** Design choices will consider accessibility standards (e.g., sufficient color contrast, semantic HTML structure for future development).

## Color Palette (Suggested - to be finalized):

*   **Primary:** A professional blue or dark gray (e.g., `#2c3e50` or `#34495e`)
*   **Secondary:** A lighter gray or off-white for backgrounds (e.g., `#f8f9fa` or `#ecf0f1`)
*   **Accent:** A vibrant color for CTAs and highlights (e.g., a warm orange `#e67e22` or a bright teal `#1abc9c`)
*   **Text:** Dark gray or black for body text (e.g., `#333333`), white or light gray for text on dark backgrounds.

## Typography (Suggested - to be finalized):

*   **Headings:** A clean sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat, Lato, Open Sans).
*   **Body Text:** A highly readable sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto, Lato).
*   **Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between heading levels (H1, H2, H3, etc.) and body text through size, weight, and spacing.

## Section-by-Section Breakdown:

### 1. Navigation Bar

*   **Visuals:**
    *   **Background:** Light solid color (e.g., `#ffffff` or a very light shade of the secondary color like `#f8f9fa`).
    *   **Shadow:** A subtle bottom shadow (e.g., `box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);`) to give it a slight lift from the page content.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Logo/Name:** "Aseel Omar" displayed on the left.
        *   Font: Primary heading font, slightly bolder or a distinct style (e.g., semibold weight).
        *   Size: Prominent enough to be easily identifiable but not overpowering.
    *   **Navigation Links:** "About", "Skills", "Projects", "Experience", "Contact" aligned to the right.
        *   Font: Standard body text font, possibly slightly larger or bolder than normal paragraph text.
        *   Spacing: Ample spacing between links for easy clicking/tapping.
        *   Hover/Active State: Links should have a clear visual cue on hover (e.g., color change to accent, underline) and an active state for the current section.
*   **Behavior:**
    *   **Sticky:** The navigation bar will remain fixed at the top of the viewport when the user scrolls down the page.
    *   **Responsive:** On smaller screens (tablets/mobiles), links will collapse into a hamburger menu icon. The menu, when opened, could slide in from the side or drop down.

### 2. Hero Section

*   **Visuals:**
    *   **Background:** Full-width. Options:
        *   Solid Color: A muted tone from the primary or secondary palette (e.g., a calm blue or a sophisticated gray).
        *   Subtle Gradient: A gentle linear gradient using shades of the primary color.
        *   Professional Image: (If Aseel opts for this) A high-quality, abstract background image that is relevant to tech or design, with an overlay to ensure text readability. Must not be distracting.
    *   **Height:** Occupies a significant portion of the viewport height on initial load (e.g., 70-90vh) to create impact.
*   **Content (Text):**
    *   **Positioning:** Centered horizontally and vertically within the section. Text should have strong visual balance.
    *   **Main Headline:** "Aseel Omar"
        *   Font: Largest and most impactful font on the page (H1).
        *   Color: High contrast against the background (e.g., white text on a dark background, or dark text on a light background).
    *   **Sub-headline:** "Front-End Developer | Building engaging and user-friendly web experiences."
        *   Font: Smaller than the main headline, but still prominent (e.g., H3 or a styled paragraph). Complements the main headline font.
        *   Color: High contrast, but potentially a slightly less prominent color than the main headline if on a similar background.
        *   Spacing: Adequate spacing below the main headline.
*   **Call to Action (CTA) Button:**
    *   **Text:** "View My Projects"
    *   **Style:**
        *   Background: Uses the accent color.
        *   Text Color: High contrast with the button background (e.g., white text on a colored button).
        *   Shape: Rounded corners for a modern feel.
        *   Padding: Generous padding for a substantial clickable area.
        *   Font: Clear, legible, slightly bold.
        *   Hover State: Clear visual feedback on hover (e.g., button color darkens/lightens, subtle shadow effect).
    *   **Position:** Located directly below the sub-headline, visually centered.

### 3. About Me Section

*   **Visuals:**
    *   **Background:** A contrasting background to the Hero section to create clear separation (e.g., if Hero is dark, About Me is light, using the secondary background color like `#f8f9fa` or `#ffffff`).
    *   **Transition:** A clean horizontal rule or just the change in background color can suffice.
    *   **Padding:** Ample padding at the top and bottom of the section.
*   **Layout:**
    *   **Desktop:** Two-column layout.
        *   Column 1 (e.g., 60% width): Text content.
        *   Column 2 (e.g., 40% width): A professional, high-quality headshot of Aseel (if available and desired). If no image, the text can be centered in a single wider column.
    *   **Mobile:** Stacks to a single column, with the image (if used) appearing above or below the text.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Heading:** "About Me" (H2 style).
